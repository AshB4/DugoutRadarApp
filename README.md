## 💡 Why I Built This

As a developer with a passion for sports and community, I created **Dugout Radar** to solve a familiar problem: local game info is scattered and unreliable. Built under real constraints, this project reflects my ability to ship full-stack apps fast — with focus on UX, clarity, and clean architecture. It aligns with the values of teams like Marucci Sports and Fox Factory, blending real-world context with developer precision.
